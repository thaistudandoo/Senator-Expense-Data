# Senator Expense Data
This is the README for the Data Wrangling project, focused on cleaning and processing the expense data of Brazilian senators. Through this project, you will learn and practice essential skills in data preparation and cleaning. The goal is to download datasets from the CEAPS (Expense Allowance for Senators' Activities) portal, perform data wrangling processes on them, and document the entire process.

# Project Description
In this project, you will work with expense data declared by Brazilian senators, available on the CEAPS portal. The dataset contains detailed information about the expenses incurred by senators, categorized by year. However, the data may contain various inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicates, incorrect formatting, and more. Your task is to carry out the data wrangling process, which involves identifying and resolving these issues, ensuring the data is suitable for further analysis.

Apart from cleaning the data, you can also explore techniques such as data merging and feature engineering. For instance, you can combine data from multiple years to create a comprehensive dataset for deeper insights. Documenting your data wrangling process, including the techniques and transformations applied, will ensure transparency and reproducibility.
